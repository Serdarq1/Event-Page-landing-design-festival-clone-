Our past speakers have worked at Facebook, Buzzfeed, IBM Design Studio, Spotify and Google.<p style="margin-top: 45    px; margin-bottom: 45px;">In our most ambitious event to date, we programmed a whole month of online activities for design leaders looking to connect with their community, share their experiences, and grow the impact they can have on their company, their product and their team.

                <p>Like you, we've spent much of the last six months on Zoom, and have had enough - so we've designed this event with your needs, full schedules and busy lives in mind!</p>
                
               <p style="width: 472px;"> Content will be spread through the month and the conference days will be interspersed with decent breaks. To help fit with your schedules, talks and Q&As will be recorded and available each day for you to watch in your own time. To ensure content is as accessible as possible we will have live transcriptions during the event and pre-recorded content will be captioned.</p>
                
               <p> Connecting with the community has always been a key part of our events and we're planning social and small-group networking events, along with entertainment and maybe even a virtual mixer or two (we couldn't have Leading Design without a cocktail/mocktail moment!) Our conference platform also allows for chat and engagement during the event with fellow attendees, our incredible speakers and sponsors.</p></div>
